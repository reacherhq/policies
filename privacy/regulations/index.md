# Privacy Regulations Reference

_Last updated: December 4, 2020_

The data privacy regulatory landscape is undergoing a lot of change. You probably have heard about the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that went into effect on May 25, 2018. There are also other regulations in effect or in the works around the world. We’ve written up this reference document to put helpful information regarding our products and privacy regulations in one place. Please also view our full [Privacy policy](../index.md).

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about our [Privacy policy](../index.md), your data, or your rights with respect to your information, please email us at [amaury@reacher.email](mailto:amaury@reacher.email).

## European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

PROXIMA B SASU is a FRENCH company and our data infrastructure is currently based in the US. That means if you are in another country in the world and you use our products, your data are transferred to the US. The EU has stronger privacy laws than the US and a core tenet of the GDPR is that if you transfer any personal data of EU residents out of the EU, you must protect it to the same level as guaranteed under EU law. There are two factors to this:

1. The practices that businesses take handling personal data; and
2. The laws of the countries where you transfer the EU personal data to

### Practices we have at Reacher

We are serious about treating our customers fairly. Please do read our [Privacy Policy](../index.md) in full. Some highlights:

- We never have and never will sell customer data.
- We don’t run ads for other services in our products.
- We limit the data we collect: if we don’t need it, we don’t ask for it.
- We limit the permissions our apps request on your devices.
- We put a lot of security measures into place including in-transit encryption, encryption at-rest, and requiring employees and contractors to sign non-disclosure agreements.
- When you email us at [amaury@reacher.email](mailto:amaury@reacher.email), someone from our Privacy Working Group will get back to you. You are always speaking with a human! No bots.

We do work with sub-processors. We've listed links to our current sub-processors at the end of this page.

Last but not least, we know privacy regulations are constantly evolving. We root for stronger consumer privacy laws!

## California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

In the CCPA, there is an important distinction between what are referred to as “service providers”, “businesses”, and “third parties”. You can see how the regulation defines these words by visiting the California Attorney General’s website: https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa.

_Under the CCPA, reacher is a “service provider.”_ That means when we process data you provide, we do so solely for the purpose you signed up for. Our business model is simple: we charge a recurring subscription fee to our customers. We do not sell personal information or use your data for any other commercial purposes unless with your explicit permission.

The CCPA also grants residents of California with additional rights related to their information. We grant those rights to all of our customers and detail them in our Privacy policy. Our Privacy policy also explains the information we collect in order to provide our services and clearly lists the only times we access or share your data.

## US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

Our products are currently _not_ [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html)-compliant and we do not have immediate plans to become so.

## Subprocessors

Reacher uses third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to provide our services. We enter into data processing agreements including GDPR Standard Contractual Clauses with each subprocessor, and require the same of them.

You can see which subprocessors we use by application by viewing the following linked lists:

- [Reacher subprocessors](../reacher-subprocessors/index.md)
- [Reacher Help Center subprocessors](../reacher-help-center-subprocessors/index.md)
